In the 1930s many of them, like Zawistowska, joined the ranks of the Communist Party of Poland and, after World War II, worked to create a new political and social reality. Nevertheless, Zawistowska\u2019s experience was in many respects exceptional. First of all, unlike 90% percent of Polish Jews, she survived the war. More significantly, her wartime odyssey encompassed so many different stages and places, far more than we would expect from a single biography spanning a short period of just a few years. Her activities in this period included: illegally crossing in fall 1939 the German-Soviet border established after the collapse and partition of the Polish state; living for more than a year and a half in the Soviet zone of occupation, first in Bia\u0142ystok and then in Galicia; time spent in the latter region under Hungarian and German rule in 1941-1942; escaping from Galicia under dramatic circumstances to reach the Warsaw ghetto, where she witnessed deportations to Treblinka; and two and a half years of hiding on the \u201cAryan side.\u201d Even this last act was more dramatic and complicated than in the cases of many other Jews who survived. In the final months of the war, after the defeat of the Polish uprising in Warsaw in fall 1944, Zawistowska hid in the ruins of the city \u2013 like W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman, whose experience Roman Pola\u0144ski presented in the Oscar-winning film <em>The Pianist</em>.

Interwar Poland was home to the largest Jewish community in Europe: 3.3 million Jews lived in the country, constituting roughly ten percent of the population. The majority were traditional, religious Jews who did not fully assimilate. They spoke Yiddish, Polish being a second language with varying levels of command. They usually lived in different neighborhoods from ethnic Poles, dressed in a recognizable way, which significantly reduced their chances of hiding and surviving the German occupation. One can assume from her testimony that Zawistowska\u2019s parents belonged to this group. Her father was a shoemaker, producing uppers. Craftsmen, along with small traders and workers, constituted the largest professional category among Polish Jews.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup> Zawistowska\u2019s family lived in \u0141\u0119czyca (she was born there in 1913), a small town in central Poland, near \u0141\u00f3d\u017a with a large Jewish community, who had lived there since the 15th century and then constituted about one-third of its population.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\">2</a></sup> "

She recounts a vibrant intellectual, cultural, and social life and brilliant professors, but also rising anti-Jewish sentiment and violence. During the 1930s, Polish universities became one of the main realms where nationalistic movements attempted to implement their antisemitic agendas, aiming at reducing the Jewish presence in Polish culture and the economy.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\">4</a></sup> Warsaw University was the biggest institution of higher education in Poland, with the largest number of Jewish students (about 23 percent when Zawistowska began her studies), and with the majority of Polish students supporting nationalistic organizations.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\">5</a></sup> In the 1930s it became one of the most significant arenas of violent actions against Jews in the country. Zawistowska recalls in her testimony anti-Jewish riots on campus, instigated by right-wing Polish students. Jewish students were physically attacked and often severely beaten. The nationalist groups had two basic demands. The first was to reduce the number of Jews at the university (so called <em>numerus clausus</em>) so that Jewish students did not exceed their percentage in the overall population. Official restrictions were never formally implemented, but met some success in practice as the various local authorities within the different departments, e.g. medicine, decided who would be admitted to study. The second demand was the separation of Jewish and non-Jewish students, with separate seats in each university auditorium \u2013 so called \u201cghetto benches.\u201d Separation was officially introduced at Warsaw University in 1937, after Zawistowska had graduated; but it had earlier been informally imposed by nationalist students who beat those Jews who did not comply and intimidated reluctant professors.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-6\"><a href=\"#fn-6\">6</a></sup> "

In fact, she had begun to be politically involved even before she began her studies at Warsaw University. Still in \u0141\u0119czyca, as a 16 year old high school pupil, she became a member of International Red Aid (known as MOPR from its Russian acronym, derived from: \u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438o\u043depa\u043c). MOPR was a relief organization that helped left-wing political prisoners and organized propaganda campaigns in their defense. It was established in Moscow by the Communist International and boasted a very large number of members (over 14 million) across the world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-7\"><a href=\"#fn-7\">7</a></sup> The organization was controlled by the Communists but enoyed the participation of numerous left-wing intellectuals and activists. In \u0141\u0119czyca there was a prison with many political prisoners, mostly Communists. Becoming involved in helping them opened for Zawistowska a path towards the Communist movement. She joined the Communist Union of the Polish Youth, a satellite organization of the Communist Party of Poland that conducted underground activities, made illegal by the Polish government.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-8\"><a href=\"#fn-8\">8</a></sup> For her father, an Orthodox Jew, her involvement with communism was \u201ca tragedy,\u201d as she mentions in her testimony. In the sociological study of this generation, based on interviews with about 100 hundred Polish Jews, Jaff Shatz found that most of them became engaged very early in the Communist movement, on average at the age of 17 in the case of children of artisans, workers and petty traders.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-9\"><a href=\"#fn-9\">9</a></sup> The reaction of the great majority of their parents was strongly negative.

Jews and other national minorities, in many ways discriminated against in interwar Poland, were highly overrepresented in the Communist movement, in which they saw an instrument for achieving a more just and equal social reality. In 1933, among members of the Communist Union of Polish Youth, to which Zawistowska belonged, Jews constituted 31 percent, Byelorussians 19 percent, Ukrainians 17 percent and ethnic Poles 33 percent (the latter constituted about two-thirds of the overall population). In the Communist Party of Poland in the 1930s the percentage of Jews oscillated around one quarter, but was much higher in its more important echelons. It is estimated that Jews constituted 75 percent of the apparatus for production and distribution of propaganda materials and occupied most of the seats on the Central Committee. Interestingly, the percentage of Jews in the party cells was usually the highest (sometimes over 60 percent) in smaller cities, like \u0141\u0119czyca where Zawistowska was born and raised.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-10\"><a href=\"#fn-10\">10</a></sup> This might be explained by the concentration of Jews in such localities and also, most likely, by their poverty and lack of opportunities for social advancement, which were more easily available in big cities. It is also worth mentioning that in the Polish section of the MOPR \u2013 where Zawistowska was active \u2013 out of its 6,000 members about 90 percent were Jews. At the same time, one should remember that Jewish Communists \u2013 there might have been up to 10,000in the 1930s \u2013 were only a tiny fraction of Poland`s Jews, the overwhelming majority of whom supported and voted for other parties, including conservative Jewish groups, Zionists and socialists from the Bund.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-11\"><a href=\"#fn-11\">11</a></sup> "

As a person known for her involvement in the Communist movement she could not get a job at any state-run school, and earned her living giving private lessons and looking after handicapped children in Jewish families. The outbreak of the war (September 1, 1939) caught her in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, where her family had lived since 1935. She soon decided, as did many other dozens of thousands of Jews (not only Communists), to flee to the Soviet zone of the partitioned Poland. In September 1939 the Soviets, acting in cooperation with Nazi Germany, invaded Poland and annexed more than half of the Polish pre-war territory, which was incorporated into the Byelorussian and Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republics. A risky but successful attempt saw Zawistowska cross the Soviet border and make it to Bia\u0142ystok, the largest town in the northern part of Soviet-occupied Poland, where many left-wing activists gathered. After some time she moved south, to Galicia, where she remained until the end of the Soviet rule in June 1941. She first worked in an orphanage in Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w (nowadays in Ukraine: Ivano-Frankivsk), one of the most important cities in this region. After having completed courses for teachers, she moved to the countryside and taught in a village school, and later again in another school back in Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w. W\u0142adys\u0142awa Zawistowska benefited from new opportunities of employment and social advancement created by the Soviet authorities. Many Jews not accessible for such positions in prewar Poland could now occupy positions in the administration and education.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-12\"><a href=\"#fn-12\">12</a></sup> However, she was not enthusiastic about Soviet reality. It might sound a paradox for a Communist activist, dedicated to the cause and imprisoned in Poland, but in fact these feelings were shared by many who made it to the Soviet zone. Zawistowska married a Polish Jew from Warsaw who had also fled from the Germans. She recalls the poverty, and even hunger, that they experienced at that time, as well as fear and knowledge about Soviet repression. She mentions deportations to the east, which included dozens of thousands of Jews who, like her, had fled the Nazis and were now regarded by the Soviet authorities as a potentially disloyal element to be forcibly removed.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-13\"><a href=\"#fn-13\">13</a></sup> On the one hand, she hid her membership in the prewar-Communist movement, since in 1938 the Communist Party of Poland was accused of \u201ctreason\u201d and \u201cworking for imperialists\u201d and dissolved by the Communist International. Many of its leaders and activists were executed or sent to the labor camps in the Soviet Union as a part of the Stalinist purges.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-14\"><a href=\"#fn-14\">14</a></sup> On the other hand, Zawistowska also kept secret that she had graduated from Warsaw University, which in the eyes of the Soviets could make her a member of the Polish elites, distrusted and persecuted by the new rulers.

It was a very risky endeavor in terms of logistics (they could be easily arrested by the police) but they decided to go, mostly because they wanted to join their families and also because it was no longer safe to stay in the Galician countryside, where the German hunt for Jews intensified. At the moment when Zawistowska took the decision to move to the Warsaw ghetto, the fate of the Jews living in the General Government (the central and biggest part of German-occupied Poland) was already sealed. In this very month the Germans began the so called <em>Aktion Reinhardt</em>, the systematic extermination of the almost two million Jews living there, mostly in three newly established annihilation camps in Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r and Treblinka. In the latter camp the majority of Jews from the Warsaw ghetto \u2013 about 240,000 \u2013 were killed within two months.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-17\"><a href=\"#fn-17\">17</a></sup> The deportations from Warsaw to Treblinka started on July 22 1942, not more than four months after Zawistowska had joined her family. One should remember, however, that in early 1942 her settling in the Warsaw ghetto might still seem a rational decision, regardless of any eagerness to be together with her family. In Galicia mass killings of Jews continued and, until <em>Aktion Reinhardt</em>, living in a ghetto in the General Government could be reasonably regarded as a safer solution. The imagination of most Jews, even the most pessimistic (or realistic), did not conceive that the Nazis would attempt to kill every single one of them. Zawistowska mentions this explicitly in her testimony, recalling what she knew and sensed at that time when she still could not conceive what was about to happen and believed that the Germans would need at least some Jews in the workforce.

In the Galician countryside they were isolated and without any resources, in Warsaw they could count not only on their families but also on a much broader network of social contacts in the city that Zawistowska knew well from before the war. Settling in the Warsaw ghetto meant joining the biggest Jewish community in German-occupied Europe. It was established in November 1940. and populated at its peak by nearly 450,000 people, including 150,000 Jews deported from other localities. The majority lived in extremely crowded and squalid conditions, continually deteriorating. This situation is reflected also in Zawistowska\u2019s testimony, where she describes how they lived after they had arrived. Having a separate bed was an unavailable luxury, they had to switch \u2013 one person using the bed at night, another sleeping during the day. The food situation was dire, for most of the Jews were shut in the ghetto and even the smuggling of goods from outside could not alleviate the shortages in the long run, and certainly not for those without financial resources. It is estimated that more than 60,000 Jews died of hunger in the Warsaw ghetto.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-18\"><a href=\"#fn-18\">18</a></sup> "

On the very same day Adam Czerniak\u00f3w, chairman of the Jewish Council in the Warsaw ghetto, committed suicide in a gesture of helpless protest.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-22\"><a href=\"#fn-22\">22</a></sup> Zawistowska\u2019s elder sister was one of the first victims, brought via the Umschlagplatz to Treblinka at the beginning of the deportations. Their parents, like many other Jews, attempted to hide in a makeshift hideout, but were discovered and also sent to their deaths. When Zawistowska learned of their fate she decided to stay outside the ghetto. She did not return from work in the shop outside the ghetto\u2019s walls and instead went to a place on the \u201cAryan side\u201d that had been arranged beforehand. Zawistowska and her husband had managed also to obtain ahead of time false birth certificates confirming their assumed Polish-Christian identity, crucial documents for Jews in hiding, which later they used to obtain identification cards issued by the German authorities. The next two and a half years she spent on \u201cthe Aryan side,\u201d hiding her Jewishness, not only surviving but also saving her brother-in-law. Zawistowska shared an apartment with a Polish family and pretended to be a Polish gentile woman who earned her living trading various goods, selling them in the streets of Warsaw. For eighteen months she kept in her room (most of the time under a bed) her husband\u2019s brother, whose appearance was too obviously Jewish for him to risk going outside. She paid each month an agreed amount of money (not very substantial) to their landlords. Occasionally, when the latter panicked and threatened to denounce her and her brother-in-law to the Germans, she blackmailed them, declaring that in such a case she would accuse them of having given consent to hiding a Jew. Her husband lived in another place, with a Polish gentile woman who protected him after having fallen in love with him. He visited Zawistowska in her apartment under the pretense of being her fianc\u00e9. Equally complicated and dramatic situations could and surely must have occurred in the extreme circumstances of these times, but Zawistowska\u2019s testimony is a rare explicit account.  "
