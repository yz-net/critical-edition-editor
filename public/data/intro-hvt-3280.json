In some senses, they are the most \u201cSoviet\u201d of Soviet Jews. Nevertheless, many of this generation retained a substantive Jewish identity that wasn\u2019t necessarily defined by the Holocaust, by late-Stalinist antisemitism, or by Soviet anti-Zionism. Instead, their Jewishness was primarily rooted in familial and hometown bonds, which continued to shape their lives long after the catastrophic Nazi occupation of 1941-1944.  "

As a child, Liubov\u2019s daily life was profoundly shaped by Soviet modernization projects. Although her father was an artisan, not a peasant, Soviet farm collectivization and the resulting food shortages had a deep impact on her family. During the Holodomor famine of 1932-1933, many families, Jewish and Ukrainian alike, decided to hand over their children to state orphanages until they could provide for them again. As Liubov\u2019 recalls, \u201c\u2026the director of our school took me and my two brothers into the orphanage, and we stayed there until I finished seventh grade. Then I returned home.\u201d The school that Liubov\u2019 attended through the ninth grade was one of over 800 secular Yiddish-language schools in Soviet Ukraine.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup> These schools, along with other Soviet minority-language schools, were designed to supplant religious educational institutions and educate Soviet youth in socialist values.

In her testimony, Liubov\u2019 recalls accompanying her parents to synagogue, celebrating religious Jewish holidays, and learning traditional prayers from her uncle. Other, non-religious aspects of traditional shtetl life also lingered, including economic and social patterns that had existed for centuries. For example, most Jews in Zvenigorodka, including Liubov\u2019s father, maintained their traditional artisanal trades as cobblers, tailors, tinsmiths, etc. In an effort to build a socialist economy, the Soviet state drove the collectivization of such artisans into \u201cartels.\u201d However, within the highly concentrated Jewish population of the former Pale of Settlement, these artels reinforced Jewish social circles and, by extension, traditional Jewish life. Furthermore, in its effort to rally popular support for the development of a socialist economy, the Soviet state pursued a policy of \u201cindigenization\u201d in the 1920s, producing popular culture that was \u201cnational in form, socialist in content.\u201d Yiddish language theater troupes and newspapers promulgated a linguistic and cultural Jewishness that appealed to secular and religious Jews alike. These cultural institutions, like the Yiddish schools, were largely shuttered in the mid-late 1930s as the Stalinist state asserted a more homogeneous Soviet culture. Nevertheless, their brief existence produced a generation of Soviet Jews whose Jewish identity was substantively Jewish and profoundly Soviet. Far from forced assimilation, Soviet modernization in provincial Ukraine reinforced Jewish identities and communities, even as these identities and communities assumed a distinctly Soviet flavor.  "

After the German Wehrmacht launched its invasion into Soviet territory on June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany rapidly seized control of vast new territories inhabited by populations it deemed racially inferior\u2014Slavs, Roma, and above all, Jews. In the initial months of the occupation, German operatives focused on eliminating potential sources of resistance, particularly Communist party officials and other \u201cradical\u201d elements. While Nazi propaganda frequently employed the words \u201ccommunist\u201d and \u201cJew\u201d interchangeably, there was no policy yet for the annihilation of Jews. Instead, the German occupiers initially confined Jews to ghettos in or near their hometowns. According to Christopher Browning, between September 18 and October 25, 1941, the Third Reich developed a comprehensive vision for the Final Solution, which was later codified at the Wannsee Conference in January 1942.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\">2</a></sup> This new vision called for the construction of industrialized extermination centers in Poland to which Jews would be deported from across Europe. Yet, even as this official policy was still being formulated, mass killing had already begun in the occupied Soviet territories. As Browning argues, the shift toward mass murder in the East was not initiated by a direct order from Berlin, but instead by local German commanders, as a matter of administrative practicality.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\">3</a></sup> Thus, in September 1941, German Einsatzgruppen and police, with the assistance of local collaborators, began to conduct mass shootings in which hundreds, sometimes thousands of Jews were murdered in ravines and forests near their hometowns. After a reprieve during the winter of 1941-1942, mass shootings resumed as ghettos were liquidated throughout 1942 and early 1943.  "

On the continuum between anti-Jewish violence and anti-Nazi resistance, non-Jews across occupied Europe exhibited a broad range of morally ambiguous reactions to the German persecution of Jews. For example, Liubov\u2019 describes the economic opportunism of some local Zvenigorodka residents following the ghettoization of their former Jewish neighbors. Desperate to supplement meager food rations, Jews were forced to sell off their household possessions. The \u201cbuyers\u201d were local non-Jews who illegally snuck into the ghetto in order to capitalize on desperation. According to Liubov,\u2019 many of the \u201cbuyers\u201d promised to bring money or food in exchange for the furniture they took, but few returned with the promised payment. Such transactions did occasionally provide Jews with extra sustenance and, technically, transactions between Jews and non-Jews defied German regulations. Thus, it is difficult to classify these interactions as simple collaboration. At the same time, asymmetrical trade contributed significantly toward the dispossession of Jews \u2013 a primary objective of German occupation policy.  "

In the Soviet Union, the history of the \u201cGreat Patriotic War,\u201d i.e. the Second World War, held deep political significance as a unifying, legitimizing myth. From the earliest months of the war, state propaganda emphasized the struggle of the Soviet people against fascism. This narrative was intended to foster unity among the Soviet Union\u2019s ethnically diverse population and to avoid fanning separatist sentiments.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-11\"><a href=\"#fn-11\">11</a></sup> Yet, the myth of the \u201cGreat Patriotic War\u201d also erased the distinct suffering of Jews under German occupation. After the war, Soviet officials avoided referencing the ethnic (much less religious) identities of civilian victims. Instead, euphemistic, generic phrases such as \u201cSoviet citizens\u201d and \u201cpeaceful residents\u201d became ubiquitous in speeches and on state-sponsored monuments. When individual citizens like Liubov\u2019 approached local authorities for permission to erect privately-funded monuments at mass shooting sites, disagreements frequently arose over the wording of the inscription or the exact number of victims. Liubov\u2019 recalls her encounter with the Zvenigorodka city council:\u00a0  "

Otherwise, as Liubov\u2019 explains, \u201cthe monuments would have been knocked down long ago.\u201d In the late 1980s or early 1990s, a visiting rabbi suggested adding a Star of David to the Zvenigorodka monuments, but Liubov\u2019 and other local survivors \u201ctalked it over and decided not to.

As Liubov\u2019 explains, for the same reason that she chose not to affix a Star of David to the monuments, she also chose not to identify herself as Jewish in her passport: \u201cIn my diplomas, everywhere, I\u2019m Ukrainian. But in my heart, I\u2019m a Jew.\u201d This dual identity, with a public and a private face, reflects the postwar experiences of Liubov\u2019 and of many other Soviet Jews. After the Second World War, many of the conditions that had allowed for the flowering of a Jewish-Soviet public identity during the 1920s and 30s evaporated \u2013 both as a result of the Nazi genocide and due to rapid postwar changes in Soviet society. After the war, the Soviet state viewed its citizens who had survived under occupation, even Jews, with deep suspicion. Furthermore, due to the hardening of Soviet anti-Zionism after the creation of the State of Israel, the Soviet state increasingly viewed its Jewish citizens as an untrustworthy, foreign element. Unofficially, Soviet educational institutions and employers began to discriminate against Jews, denying them access to the types of social mobility they had enjoyed in the 1920s and 30s. The shuttering of the few remaining secular Jewish institutions in the late 1940s compounded the devastation that the Nazi occupation had exacted on Jewish cultural and communal life.  "

Having experienced a time when it was possible to be both Jewish and Soviet, they maintained a dual self-image as Jewish and fully Soviet, doggedly navigating Soviet society to the best of their abilities despite growing discrimination. In contrast, younger Soviet Jews, who came of age after the war, had few positive memories of being Jewish and experienced their Jewishness primarily as a source of shame. Some later rebelled against this stigma by embracing Zionism and fighting for the right to emigrate. However, a more common tendency among both the older and the younger generation was to confine their Jewishness to the private sphere \u2013 to the family and the home, or even to the secrecy of their personal memories.
