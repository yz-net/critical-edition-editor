Her observant Jewish family belonged to the upper-middle class \u2013 her father Friedrich Kummermann was a successful textile merchant. Martha was well educated, and an entrepreneur herself. In 1931 she married Hrand Saraffian, an Armenian Christian refugee from Constantinople, with whom she had two daughters, Noemi and Hanna. Despite her civil marriage to a Protestant, Martha Saraffian remained a member of the Jewish community and their first daughter, Noemi, was raised as Jewish. After the annexation the Saraffian family was discriminated against, persecuted for their \u201cmixed marriage.\u201d<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup> Martha Saraffian was eventually deported to the Ghetto Theresienstadt/Terez\u00edn in 1945 and her husband interned in several forced labor camps. While many of Martha\u2019s family members perished in the Holocaust, including her mother who was murdered near Lublin, the couple and their children survived in occupied Czechia. After liberation, they emigrated to Argentina and later, in the 1960s, after Hrand had passed away, to New York City, where Martha lived until December 2006.  "

First, it is one of the few first-generation testimonies in the Fortunoff Archive of a Jew surviving the Holocaust in a mixed marriage.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\">2</a></sup> Indeed, her testimony concerns the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, where conditions for such families were in many respects even worse than in many areas of the Reich proper. Second, she was married to a survivor of the Armenian massacres in Ottoman Turkey, a stateless refugee, who was nonetheless considered \u201cAryan\u201d under the Nuremberg Race Laws. For Hrand Saraffian, the Holocaust was the second major experience of persecution in his life. This intersection of the history of the Armenian genocide and the Holocaust in the lives of one family is certainly unique. Their experiences during the Holocaust are nevertheless representative of the fate of many Czech and Sudeten-German mixed marriages. Martha Saraffian\u2019s testimony revolves primarily around her experience as an \u201cintermarried\u201d Jew, the fate of her children, persecuted as Jewish \u201c<em>Mischlinge</em>,\u201d of her husband\u2019s slave labor, as well as her own experience as a forced laborer in Prague and later in Theresienstadt ghetto.

This crown land, one part of the historic Czech lands, which had received a certain degree of autonomy after the Austrian-Hungarian compromise of 1867, was the major site of an ongoing national conflict between Austrian Czechs and Austrian Germans.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-12\"><a href=\"#fn-12\">12</a></sup> The Czechs, who were the majority in Bohemia, had strived for national autonomy or even independence for decades. Most Germans in the region fiercely opposed any such initiative. Bohemia was therefore an epicenter of both German and Czech nationalism and radicalization. It is thus not surprising that in 1903 the German Workers\u2019 Party, an early forerunner of the Austrian and German-Czech National Socialist movement, was founded in the heavily industrialized region. Bohemian Jews were caught in the middle of this national struggle between Czechs and Germans, which also extended to other regions of the monarchy, such as Moravia and even Vienna.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-13\"><a href=\"#fn-13\">13</a></sup> In the 18th and 19th centuries the majority of Bohemian Jews had identified as Germans, at least on paper, as the Austro-Hungarian system of nationality was based on self-identification and the self-declared everyday language of its citizens.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-14\"><a href=\"#fn-14\">14</a></sup> Hence these national identities were always fluid and never cemented. Identifications began to shift towards the Czech side at the turn of the century, especially in the Czech majority areas, and a vocal minority of Bohemian Jews also supported Zionism. However, many citizens of the region, whether Jewish or not, were in the truest sense \u201cmulticultural\u201d and bilingual, at least to some degree, and shifting identifications were also a matter of political allegiances. According to the 1910 census, 62.66% of the inhabitants of Bohemia spoke Czech (including Slovakian) as their daily common language, whereas 36.45% were German speakers (in Austria-Hungary as a whole 23.36% were German speakers, 19.57% Hungarian speakers and 12.54% spoke Czech and Slovakian, the rest other languages). Jews accounted for only 1.5% of the entire Bohemian population at the time. However, in Prague, Jews accounted for a large part, perhaps even the majority, of the city\u2019s German population.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-15\"><a href=\"#fn-15\">15</a></sup> "

German separatists began to refer to these regions, which did not form a political unity until the Nazi annexation in October 1938, as <em>Sudetenland</em>, the land of the Sudeten-Germans. While these areas were not granted any form of autonomy by the Czechoslovakian state, German was still used as an official administrative and educational language. In her testimony, Saraffian refers to this linguistic and political change in meaning: \u201cAnd we moved to the Sudeten. At this time, it was Austria. It was not Sudeten.\u201d Despite the political changes after World War I, Trautenau remained an almost entirely German-speaking town with around 13,000 inhabitants.  "

His father, Emanuel Kummermann, born in the mid-1830s, was a merchant in Humpoletz.

However, for the 1921 census the authorities also introduced the option of \u201cJewish\u201d as a national affiliation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-35\"><a href=\"#fn-35\">36</a></sup> German and Hungarian nationalists decried this as an attempt to weaken Jewish affiliation with their respective minorities. In 1921, under 15 percent of Bohemian Jews identified as \u201cnational Jews\u201d \u2013 the others as Czechs or Germans. In total, however, about half of the 354,000 Czechoslovakian Jews made this identification; in the East, Carpatho-Ukraine and Slovakia, it was over 90 percent. By the late 1920s the numbers of \u201cnational Jews\u201d increased in Bohemia, with around 20 percent declaring Jewish nationality, 50 percent Czech and 30 percent German.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-36\"><a href=\"#fn-36\">37</a></sup> According to J\u00f6rg Osterloh\u2019s estimate, about 30 percent of Jews in the later Reich District Sudetenland, which included Trautenau, identified as national Jews in the early 1930s and most of the others as Germans and some as Czechs.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-37\"><a href=\"#fn-37\">38</a></sup> The exact numbers for Trautenau were 13.35 percent in 1921 and 19.23 in 1930; the other Jews identified as Germans.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-38\"><a href=\"#fn-38\">39</a></sup> In 1921, the entire Kummermann family declared German nationality and Jewish religion.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-39\"><a href=\"#fn-39\">40</a></sup> This is perhaps not surprising in a then almost exclusively German-speaking town, where even the bilingual Czech-German Czechoslovakian census forms were filled out entirely in German. As Wolf Gruner convincingly argues, in the mid-1930s the situation of German-speaking Jews in Czechoslovakia became increasingly precarious. On the one hand radical antisemitism was rapidly increasing, foremost among the Sudeten-Germans, on the other hand, Czech nationalists labelled them national traitors, siding with the Germans.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-40\"><a href=\"#fn-40\">41</a></sup> "

Initially discriminated against but now tolerated and considered loyal to the Turkish authorities, in the last quarter of the 19th century a strong movement for Armenian national independence grew throughout the Empire. The Ottoman authorities answered with severe repression and several bloody massacres in many Armenian communities in the 1890s. The years 1894 to 1896 saw a campaign of mass killings, the so-called \u201cHamidian massacres,\u201d with 80,000 to 300,000 Armenians murdered, according to varying estimates, and up to 50,000 children orphaned.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-42\"><a href=\"#fn-42\">44</a></sup> It is very likely that Hrand Saraffian and his siblings were among these orphans and were brought to Europe in a humanitarian effort, perhaps organized by Armenians living in the diaspora.

While we lack further details, one indication that he indeed moved to Vienna as a boy or teenager is an Upper Austrian newspaper report from 1908. The newspaper reported a 16-year old Turkish servant from Constantinople, by the name of \u201cRhand Sarafian,\u201d who was the victim of sexual harassment by a known offender when he stayed overnight in Wels during a journey. The police intervened and the servant continued his journey to Vienna, according to the report.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-44\"><a href=\"#fn-44\">47</a></sup> Perhaps even before the end of the war, Hrand Saraffian moved to Bohemia, and began to trade in Persian carpets. Trading businesses, especially those importing Turkish and Oriental goods, were widespread among the European Armenian diaspora. In a Czech newspaper from April 1924 it is mentioned that, in 1922, Saraffian already traded with Persian carpets in Karl\u00edn, which today is part of Prague.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-45\"><a href=\"#fn-45\">48</a></sup> According to his citizen registration card, he moved to Trautenau on December 7, 1929, coming from Rumburg/Rumburk, a town in northwestern Bohemia.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-46\"><a href=\"#fn-46\">49</a></sup>Another interesting detail on the registration card is that he apparently had already been married before: in 1922 Hrand Saraffian married an unidentified woman in Hohenelbe/Vrchlab\u00ed, just west of Trautenau.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-47\"><a href=\"#fn-47\">50</a></sup> It is unclear if the marriage ended in divorce or if his first wife died.

In the testimony she draws parallels between the Jewish and the Armenian experience.

Apparently, they hoped that her cousin would talk her out of the relationship to a non-Jew, but he did not.

According to Martha\u2019s mother, the grandmother had been so deeply disturbed by her granddaughter\u2019s plan of marrying a non-Jew that she fell ill. Her parents\u2019 opposition caused emotional hardship for Martha, which were exacerbated by her father\u2019s poor health and his temporary refusal to speak to her.

Nevertheless, he characterizes it as a tightknit community, with many institutions, clubs, and a vibrant social life. Conversions were relatively uncommon in Trautenau. Intermarriage rates, however, were high throughout Czechoslovakia towards the 1930s (around 30 percent of all marriages involving a Jewish spouse). Martha\u2019s parents were apparently deeply unhappy with their daughter\u2019s choice for a life partner. It may have been a small comfort that she did not convert to Christianity, as the Czechoslovakian marriage law allowed for interreligious civil marriages. For Martha Saraffian this rift with her parents was quite painful, as we learn from the testimony. It seems likely that it was not only religion alone that caused the opposition of her parents: Hrand Saraffian\u2019s national status, his citizenship, was extremely unclear, and contemporary citizenship law mandated that Martha Kummermann lost her Czechoslovakian citizenship when she married a foreigner.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-50\"><a href=\"#fn-50\">54</a></sup> "

They felt safe in Czechoslovakia for the longest time and most made no preparations for emigration. Things began to change slightly in the mid-1930s, when more and more German-Jewish refugees arrived in Czechoslovakia and reports of the Nazi persecution of Jews and political enemies circulated widely. At the same time, domestic antisemitism was also on the rise \u2013 both among the Sudeten-Germans and the Czech majority. Nevertheless, until early 1938 the threat posed by Nazism seemed far away. With the annexation of Austria, Czechoslovakia was suddenly encroached upon by Nazi Germany from the north, west, and south \u2013 and the situation became more threatening.  "

We do not know if Hrand and Martha Saraffian contemplated emigration or even tried to acquire the necessary documents. By any means, it would have been very hard by this point in time. Unlike many German and Austrian Jews, Czechoslovakian Jewry was caught mostly by surprise by the events of September/October 1938 and the full annexation in March 1939. Suddenly surrounded by Nazi Germany and its Slovak Ally and the immediate outbreak of the war against Poland in the summer, there was nowhere in the vicinity left to flee. Obtaining emigration visas had already become increasingly hard by mid-1939.

At the end of December 1938, Hitler had decided that, under certain conditions, he would spare intermarried Jews from forcible resettlement to so-called Jewish living areas.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-60\"><a href=\"#fn-60\">66</a></sup> These exemptions \u2013 foremost for families in which the husband and the children were non-Jewish \u2013 were the first steps in what would evolve into the precarious statuses of a merely \u201cprotected\u201d and of a \u201cprivileged\u201d mixed marriage.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-61\"><a href=\"#fn-61\">67</a></sup> The latter were granted further exemptions, depending on gender constellations and children. Following this initial decision, most antisemitic regulations contained special clauses for mixed marriages. One such exemption was implemented in the police decree mandating the visual marking of Jews through a patch. From September 1941 onwards, all Jews in the Reich and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia were forced to wear this patch on their clothes, visibly identifying them as Jews.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-62\"><a href=\"#fn-62\">68</a></sup> Paragraph 3 of the police degree ordering the mandatory identification contained an exemption clause for Jews in mixed marriages, if they had children raised as non-Jews, and for Jewish women who were married to non-Jews; not, however, for Jewish men married to non-Jewish women without children. Such exemption clauses prompted mixed families to hope that they would be spared from deportations and eventually even regain their rights.

His decision was announced on September 29, 1941. In breaking with policy in Germany properand Austria, Jewish spouses in such marriages were to be treated just as all other Jews. This decision was reversed by the authorities in Berlin in October of the same year, when it was decided that, for the Protectorate\u2019s German-Jewish marriages the exemptions would still apply, but not, however, for Czech-Jewish marriages.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-64\"><a href=\"#fn-64\">70</a></sup> From this point onwards two different types of mixed marriages existed in the Protectorate. Essentially all Czech-Jewish marriages were robbed of their \u201cprivileges\u201d and became merely \u201cprotected\u201d. It is not clear how the Saraffian family was categorized in this respect, given their non-German citizenship and their statelessness. It should be noted that the relevant parts of the Nuremberg laws defining Jews and non-Jews did not differentiate based on citizenship but operated with the terms Jewish and \u201cof German and related blood\u201d. A person without German citizenship could thus still be \u201cof German and related blood\u201d and the marriage would still be considered \u201cmixed\u201d and protected. In fact, the German census contained information on intermarriages, with Germans and stateless persons in one category, and persons with foreign citizenships in the other. However, most exemptions and so-called \u201cprivileges\u201d granted for mixed marriages only applied when there were no children raised as Jews. For example, the exemption from wearing the yellow star stated that the children must have been registered as non-Jews. In the Saraffian\u2019s case, Noemi had been registered as Jewish, as her Trautenau citizen registration clearly shows, making her a \u201c<em>Geltungsj\u00fcdin</em>,\u201d a <em>Mischling</em> who was \u201cdeemed Jewish.\u201d So even if the Saraffian family was indeed considered a German-Jewish couple (which we do not know) and not a Czech-Jewish mixed marriage, the family would have not been \u201cprivileged\u201d and Martha Saraffian and her daughter were still required to wear the patch: \u201cWe got these stars, my Jewish daughter and I. And we had to carry all the-- through the end of the war.\u201d Martha Saraffian also received ration cards marked with \u201cJew,\u201d which were considerably lower than those for non-Jews and even those for Jews in \u201cprivileged\u201d mixed marriages. Jews usually did not receive any rations of meat, fresh fruits and vegetables, and other essential foods. Even basic staples such as fat or salt were issued in insufficient amounts.  "

The Protectorate\u2019s Ministry for Economy and Labor instructed its subordinate offices in March 1943 that Jews \u201cliving in German-Jewish mixed marriages and, according to the Police decree of September 1, 1941 on the identification of Jews, are exempt from mandatory identification [\u2026]\u201d are not to be called for labor duty, whereas \u201cJews living in Czech-Jewish mixed marriages are mandated to be identified based on a special provision\u201d and thus also subject to slave labor.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-74\"><a href=\"#fn-74\">82</a></sup> The fact that Martha was not called up for labor at this time is a good indicator that her marriage was considered German-Jewish rather than Czech-Jewish.

Of these, 88.2% had non-Jewish family members. 6,028 Jews in the Protectorate were living in mixed marriages, 196 more were either married to <em>Mischlinge</em> or were unmarried with children counting as <em>Mischlinge</em>. Another 1,260 <em>Mischlinge</em> were \u201cdeemed Jewish\u201d (<em>Geltungsjuden</em>), such as Noemi Saraffian, because they were members of the Jewish community. Only 3,470 or 40.9% of the entire group were Jewish by religion at the end of 1943, the majority either Christians or unaffiliated. The number of <em>Mischlinge</em> children was only estimated in the report: 13,000 first-degree <em>Mischlinge</em> (with two Jewish grandparents) and 34,000 second-degree <em>Mischlinge</em> (one Jewish grandparent).

In July 1944 the Protectorate\u2019s labor offices summoned intermarried non-Jews and <em>Mischlinge</em> for forced labor duty. An internal document of the German State Minister for Bohemia and Moravia from late August 1944 stated: \u201cfirst degree Mischlinge and Aryans living in Jewish mixed marriages are called up for special labor assignment outside of their places of residence. [\u2026] The calling up to the labor assignment is a temporary measure; the right to abode continues.\u201d<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-77\"><a href=\"#fn-77\">85</a></sup> This action mirrored similar efforts in the Old Reich of making <em>Mischlinge</em> and non-Jewish spouses available for forced labor.

In some regions only a fraction was eventually assigned to these deployments. In the Protectorate it was apparently implemented very strictly. Hrand Saraffian was ordered to an unidentified coal town, where he had to clear rubble and other bomb damage caused by Allied aerial bombing. He was part of a labor detachment that consisted only of intermarried men, according to the testimony: \u201call these men that has Jewish woman. All these Christian men had Jewish women.\u201d  "
