Balicka mentions blackmailers (szmalcownicy) only once, but they appear in many other testimonies. Jews were blackmailed when they did not wear a compulsory band with the Star of David and when leaving the ghetto. In 1941 the Germans introduced the death penalty for Jews in hiding and those who helped them. The blackmailers extorted money and valuables from Jews and from Poles helping them. This practice became more widespread after the \u201cGreat Action\u201d in the summer of 1942, when numerous Jews attempted to survive among Poles on the Aryan side of Warsaw. The scale of blackmailing is difficult to assess but there is no doubt that its influence was significant.
