On October 9, 1991, at the age of 83, she recorded an interview for the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\">3</a></sup> In her testimony, she recalls memories from before, during, and after the Holocaust. Esther tells, for example, how she grew up in a traditional religious household in a Jewish neighborhood and attended a secular Jewish school. Consequently, she had few encounters with antisemitism in her youth. When Esther was a young adult aspiring to be a physician, however, she had to confront antisemitism in the form of the <em>numerus clausus</em>. This cap on the number of Jewish students able to pursue medical education in Poland, combined with limits on women\u2019s enrollment in Polish medical schools, forced her to turn elsewhere for her professional education: France. Upon her return to Lodz in 1933, she embarked on her medical career in pediatrics and then as a doctor for a union health scheme. This period of her life included marriage and further confrontations with antisemitism.  "

Esther\u2019s testimony is an especially valuable and intriguing source, as it provides an entry point into several important discussions and illuminates critical subjects that have hitherto received minimal attention from Holocaust scholars. This piece will, for example, address the oft-overlooked centrality of Esther\u2019s geographical region to the history of the Holocaust, and it will engage with the challenging topic of (the judgment of) Jewish functionaries, who, in one way or another and to varying degrees, facilitated the Nazis\u2019 achievement of their goals to exploit and to murder European Jewry.

As a result, one of the functions of this introductory essay is to serve as a guide for how to read Esther\u2019s testimony between the lines and as a corrective to several historiographical tropes she and interviewer Jaschael Pery voice about the Holocaust. Because Esther\u2019s opinions emerge from her extrapolation from, and reasoning based on, her own experience, the conclusions she reaches emerge from a relatively small window of insight \u2013 an individual\u2019s perspective. In contrast, this introduction builds upon a new body of archive- and testimony-based research that challenges some of those commonly held historiographical positions.  "

As noted above, Esther believed that any interest on the part of German ghetto authorities stemmed from their fear that the proliferation of epidemics in the ghetto could pose a threat to their own health and the health of others on the \u201cAryan\u201d side. Yet Esther\u2019s own words elsewhere in her testimony challenge her assumption and therefore communicate that another factor contributed to at least some German officials\u2019 attention to Jewish doctors in the ghetto. The key indication is her recollection that, when Jewish doctors were transporting patients in a droshky to a hospital in a different sector of the ghetto, officials lifted the prohibition on Jews crossing between different parts of the ghetto at street level. She says: \u201cthe gate they opened for the <em>doro\u017cka</em>\u2026 we had to pass and in a quickie.\u201d<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-50\"><a href=\"#fn-50\">50</a></sup> In all other circumstances, Jews had to use bridges over the \u201cAryan\u201d streets in order to cross from one section of the ghetto to another without encountering the population outside the barbed wire. The inconsistency between this allowance and her belief that German officials acted entirely out of concern for their own health emerges from the fact that the transport of potentially contagious patients through the midst of non-Jews and in close proximity to those manning the ghetto\u2019s gates actually placed those people at risk. This exception undermined the German authorities\u2019 efforts to contain epidemics within the ghetto and its inhabitants. Esther\u2019s description of the patient transport thus reveals that official policy was not always focused on the prevention of disease transmission; the practice appears to have been geared towards facilitating Jewish doctors\u2019 treatment of ghetto inhabitants in need of medical care, regardless of the nature of the patients\u2019 conditions.

        "text": "Given the relative lack of scholarship about Jewish doctors\u2019 provision of medical aid to fellow Jews in the contexts of ghettos, concentration camps, and DP camps, Esther\u2019s recollections of her medical career are of great value to scholars and students alike. Furthermore, when approached in a particular way, her testimony can yield even more insight, as her work as a physician can serve as a lens through which to examine the Holocaust and its aftermath \u2013 not only her own experience but also the micro and macro contexts in which she worked. In turn, the combination of absorbing her words and reading between the lines reveals the immense value of ghetto doctors\u2019 and prisoner-physicians\u2019 accounts, as these sources present rich insights. For instance, they enable the tracing of a professional practice, its successes and challenges, across a number of sites. They shed light on attempts to adhere to the Hippocratic Oath in dire circumstances, often at the intersection of two major goals of the Holocaust\u2019s numerous perpetrators: the exploitation of the Jewish workforce and the extermination of European Jewry. With the pursuit of healing as a constant across the survivors\u2019 Holocaust and postwar experiences, these doctors\u2019 accounts provide a unique mode of comparison between different places and stages of persecution and imprisonment, and, in turn, they can offer a perspective on \u00a0the continuities and ruptures across both sides of liberation.
